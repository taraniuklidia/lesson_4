                Like many of <mark>Miyazaki Hayao’s films</mark>, Howl’s Moving Castle has a  multi-dimensional female lead. Sophie, <br> however, is unusual for a Ghibli  protagonist. While most are young women, she is an aged hero: a young woman <br>  turned old by a witch who was jealous of her beauty and youth. While this  might be a curse, and while Sophie <br> despairs at first, across the story she  gains strength, freedom, and wisdom from her time spent in a “cursed”  <br> body–all of which is then used to challenge classic definitions of beauty.
            </p>
        
            <p>
                When the movie begins, Sophie is timid and demure and full of self-doubt.  Even when Sophie is rescued by Howl,<br>  the magician, she denies this, telling  her friends that Howl only seeks out beautiful girls. Sophie doesn’t <br> consider  herself to be beautiful, and it informs her self-worth.

                In dominant social narratives, beauty represents youth, and young and  beautiful is the most important thing <br> for a woman to be. Naomi Wolf’s The  Beauty Myth explains that youth and beauty are so interconnected that <br> older  women are cast aside and seen as worthless, such that they are rarely even  seen in media. Wolf also <br> explains that the beauty myth keeps women  self-focused and self-doubting. Wolf explains that the media “ignore <br> older  women or pretend they don’t exist: magazines try to avoid photographs of  older women, and when they <br> feature celebrities who are over sixty,  ‘retouching artists’ conspire to ‘help’ beautiful women look more <br> beautiful;  i.e., less their age.”

                <p><i class="italic-color quote" >"The mess which Sophie had to clean in the Howl’s house."</i></p>
            </div>

            <p>
                This dismissal of older women is found even in anime, where infamous  “Christmas cake” jokes devalue the worth <br> of any woman who dares to be  unmarried and over 25, an idiom which is thankfully being phased out. Even if  <br> she is under a curse, Sophie is still unique as she is not only aging but  visibly elderly for much of the <br> movie. 
            </p>
        </div>

    
        <div class="textblock">
            <p>
                The Witch of the Waste, seeking out Howl’s heart and jealous of Sophie, casts  a curse that turns her into an <br> old woman. As Sophie can no longer be  conventionally beautiful, the witch believes she has eliminated all  <br> competition–labeling Sophie as such even though she has shown no intention of  pursuing Howl at the time. The <br> beauty myth naturally pits old and young  against one another, breaking the bond between women of different  <br> generations: “The links between generations of women must always be newly  broken: Older women fear young ones, <br> young women fear old, and the beauty  myth truncates for all the female life span.” 
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Afraid of her age, the witch tries to cast spells to make herself more  desirable. Like many women, she strives <br> for a youthful appearance and draws  on potions and rituals to maintain her youth.  Wolf explains that women <br> are  never able to escape these rituals. Aged women are not free to put the rites  of beauty behind them, even <br> when society tells them they are unwanted. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Cursing Sophie with old age is the ultimate defeat through the eyes of the  witch, because the beauty myth does <br> not show age as desirable. Like many  women, Sophie is upset and frightened by her age. She initially tries to <br> hide  it, concealing herself from her mother. Her mother, in turn, shares traditional  beliefs about beauty by <br> pointing out that Sophie sounds like a “ghastly”  90-year-old woman. Sophie, distressed by her appearance, runs <br> away and hides  in the wastes. As Anushka Rees notes in Beyond Beautiful, hiding is a very common  choice for <br> women who believe they do not meet conventional standards of beauty.
            </p>

            <p>
                While hiding in the wastes, Sophie finds a haven in Howl’s castle. Still  uncomfortable with her aged <br> appearance, she once jokes that she is the  scariest witch of them all, which aligns with Wolf’s observation <br> that older  women are often seen as dismissable old hags. Though Sophie initially  believes that her only value <br> is as a housekeeper, she finds that her strong  feelings are providing her with vitality. Once timid, Sophie <br> becomes aware of  her strengths. She also becomes aware of her contentment. She begins to  appreciate her age, <br> declaring that it sets her free. The more alive and  self-accepting Sophie feels, the more beautiful she <br> becomes. It is by  accepting her age, wisdom and deep feelings that she can project herself into  the <br> world—and, though she does not notice it at first, begin to break the  curse itself.

            </div>

            <p>
                While Sophie begins a path of self-growth, Howl shows that the harmful impact  of beauty myths are not only <br> limited to women. Howl colours his hair badly  after Sophie has cleaned and rearranged the bathroom and <br> dramatically wails  that “there’s no point in living if [he] can’t be beautiful”—echoing Wolf’s  discussion <br> about a lack of beauty being the worst thing that can happen to a  person. For a moment, both Howl and Sophie <br> are overcome with grief. Sophie  declares that she has never been beautiful and runs into the rain to cry.  <br> Even in his despair, it is simple for Howl to magically fix his hair in a  moment; Sophie, however, is still <br> trapped under several additional layers of  social stigma. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Howl reveals that his obsession with beauty hides deeper fears, as he is  being pressured to use his magic to <br> intervene in the ongoing war. Sophie, no  longer burdened with expectations of prettiness, finds herself able <br> to engage  with political life for the first time as she goes to the palace in Howl’s  place. On her way there, <br> she meets the Witch of the Waste and asks her to  break the spell upon her. The witch reveals that she cannot. <br> Her powers  stripped from her at the palace, she is revealed to be a harmless old woman.

            </div>

            <p>
                Sophie is juxtaposed against the witch, who once used spells to create  beauty, but is old and frail. However,<br>  she, too, ultimately regains her  vitality. Initially selfish and vain, pursuing a man who did not want her,  <br> she ends up showing her own growth by helping Sophie. As the movie comes to  an end, the witch and Sophie are <br> no longer rivals. Sophie takes care of the  witch in her elderly state, and the witch both metaphorically and <br> literally  relents her supposed claim on Howl’s heart.
            </p>


            <p>
                When Sophie tells the witch that she has “a big heart,” our younger and older  women are united as both leave <br> the beauty myth behind. While the beauty myth  is designed to artificially pit generations of women against <br> each other,  acceptance of the wisdom of age does the very opposite. As Sophie and the  witch grow together, <br> each is able to offer value to the other. Sophie and the  witch grow more vital and alive once the false <br> “competition” over Howl is  left behind. 
            </p>

            <p>
                As Sophie reveals her inner strength and passion, her youth begins to return  to her. Sophie reveals that <br> passion, self-acceptance and wisdom are the true  roots of beauty. No longer timid, Sophie doesn’t need potions <br> to break the  spell of age. Instead, she stands in her strength and power. This enables her  to free herself, <br> Howl and her friends from sorcery. As Howl has his heart  returned to him, he comments on Sophie’s grey hair, <br> telling her it has all  the beauty of the stars—a poetic compliment that rejects grey hair’s usual  association <br> with old age and thus ugliness. Even more importantly, Sophie’s  response is that she too likes her new hair; <br> ending the story with her  self-love equally important to that of her romantic partner.

            <p>
                Howl’s Moving Castle shows the strength of a female protagonist who is  willing to embrace her age, and whose <br> age sets her free from convention and  lets her explore her wisdom and her deep feelings. Sophie’s true  <br> transformation is her reliance on inner strength to survive the curse of not  being beautiful. In doing so, she<br>  not only shows true beauty but restores the  hearts of others.

                While chasing after youth, vitality and appearance seem to promise love,  Howl’s Moving Castle shows a <br> different truth. In this narrative,  self-acceptance, wisdom and growth are powerful. Sophie’s strength is  <br> juxtaposed against the fragility of the Beauty Myth, which causes jealousy,  insecurity and the need for women <br> to compete.
            </p>

            <p>
                By presenting a complex female lead with a beauty that is more than skin  deep, Howl’s Moving Castle shows that <br> beauty does not die with age. Instead,  it increases with wisdom. In this way, the movie challenges ageism as <br> well as  the limited roles women can play in a hero’s story. Howl’s Moving Castle  shows that true love defies <br> age and that true strength comes when we no  longer run from the aging process.
